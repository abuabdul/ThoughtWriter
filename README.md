<h1 id="thoughtwriter"><a href="#thoughtwriter" class="anchor">ThoughtWriter</a></h1>

<p>ThoughtWriter is a small application developed on top of ScalaFX!! This is an inspiration project from ScalaFX development. This application is mostly benefited from <a href="https://github.com/scalafx/Scalafx-ensemble">ScalaFX Ensemble</a> project which demonstrates the ScalaFX api through demos with code samples. Developed with scalafx-1.0-snapshot, this can be improved with stable release of ScalaFX api in future.</p>
